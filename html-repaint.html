		HTML Repaint is in a sense like repainting over an existing document. Changes are made to the "skin" without affecting the existing lay out. Repainting could include background color, out line, and visibility.</p>
        <p>
        Most of my research described html repaint as expensive, this is in terms of performance (speed &amp; smoothness) and the direct object model must also be considered for this very reason.
