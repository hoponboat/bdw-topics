    <p>"Elements with a relative position value are like Clark Kent. They hide far greater powers than their static siblings." A List Apart</p>
      <div>
        <p>There is natural way CSS stacks information. These are types of boxes that stack in what's called normal flow. Giving elements a position delegates where it stacks. this can be done in 4 ways; static, relative, absolute, and fixed.
        </p>
    <h2>CSS positioning, static</h2>
        <p> Static positioning is described as the default setting. They stack in order of how they are written. This should be used for single columned layouts.</p>
    <h2>CSS positioning, relative</h2>
        <p>
        Relative positioning is the next step in positioning. You can add offset properties like top, left, right, and bottom. 
        </p>
    <h2>CSS positioning, absolute</h2>
      <p>Absolute positioning provides more ultilty that relative positioning. With absolute positioning the box can be fluid. For example a box will stay flow in the browser when the viewport is resized.</p>
    <h2>CSS positioning, fixed</h2>
      <p>Fixed positioning is the final property used to adust CSS layout. The name says enough. The an element is fixed it stays in place, like when you scroll down a page.</p>
