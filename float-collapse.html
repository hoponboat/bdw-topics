    <h1>float collapse</h1> 
      <div>
        <p>Float is a tool that allows for a desired positioning on the page. A webpage has a flow, and you would use float to remove certain elements from the that page flow. Therefore they are seperate d. Float left, float right, position absolute, and clear float.</p>
        <p>
          Float collapse is related to page flow and is also an organizational tool. If two or more elements have the same parents then they can be grouped together. Collapsing is a technique that solves cross browers issues, and lay out problems. As Noah Stokes puts it, positioning is everything.
