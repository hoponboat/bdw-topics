        <p>Clearfix is another technique used to compartmentalized the page flow. This is a type of CSS float element that fixes float based lay out "parent issues", one example being container height.

        Cearfix allows for floating divs without additional structural mark up, better lay out and less html. Clearfix nesting seems to be an popular alternative approach to mendning the same problem.
