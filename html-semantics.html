        <p>
          Semantics is the defined as the study of meaning. I gather that html semantics give meaning to the content. Semantics furthermore help the developer to easier group or catagorize content. HTML semantics are use to organize the html language.

          Examples of semantica include section, header, nav, article, footer, hgroup, aside, time, and mark. I was not aware of the last two semantics. Time is actually a clock time, and mark is a highlighting feature. Mark Pilgram in his blog compares sections to chapters in a book, and makes the point that footers also seem to contain legal information.
