          HTML special characters as I understand are a series of type or characters used to universally describe or represent a punctuation or symbol. This means items like colons, apostrophes, parenthesis would actually be typed out in a long hand rather than simply using a the key on the board. For instance, the greek letter delta would be typed out as &Delta;. The long hand translates across browsers and makes for smooth compatibility.

         HTML special characters are also refered to as entities. Entities live within character sets. The UTF-8 is the most universal of character sets languages because it is used in languages like Chinese and Japanese, developed with Asian influence and culture, and as Jake Rocheleao puts it "modern languages" in mind.
